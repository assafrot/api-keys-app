# Cursor AI Rules for API Keys App

## Git & Version Control
- **NEVER** automatically commit or push changes to git without explicit user request
- Always ask user for permission before running `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`
- When user requests git operations, provide clear commit messages describing the changes
- Only stage and commit files that are directly related to the requested changes

## Development Guidelines
- Maintain the modular component structure established in the codebase
- Use existing TypeScript interfaces and follow established patterns
- Reuse existing components (Toast, Sidebar, etc.) when possible
- Follow the established file organization:
  - Components in `/app/dashboard/components/`
  - Hooks in `/app/dashboard/hooks/`
  - API routes in `/app/api/`
  - Pages as `/app/[route]/page.tsx`

## Code Quality
- Always run linting checks after making changes
- Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Test functionality locally before suggesting deployment
- Use the existing Tailwind CSS classes and design system

## Communication
- Provide clear explanations of changes made
- Use todo lists to track progress on multi-step tasks
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Inform user about any potential breaking changes

## File Management
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless specifically requested
- Don't create documentation files unless explicitly asked
- Clean up any temporary files created during development
